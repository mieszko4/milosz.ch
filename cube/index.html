		<h1>My Cube Bike Story</h1>
		
		<p>How long should a person wait for support from <a href="http://www.cube.eu/">Cube</a>?</p>
    <p>I've waited a few months... And I am still left with no reply... Let start the story from the beginning.</p>
    
    <h2>My Cube</h2>
    
    <p>About 3 years ago I decided to buy a new bicycle. After long time of searches and consultations with my friends, some of them professional bikers, I decided to buy a <strong>Cube LTD PRO 29er 2013</strong>.</p>

    <p>I really wanted a high quality bicycle so I carefully studied all the parts it was made of before choosing and purchasing one. All the parts seemed to be of great quality, <a href="http://www.shimano.com/">Shimano</a> parts etc. And since I've paid for my bicycle far over <strong>1000€</strong> I was pretty confident that I made the right choice.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Bike Maintenance</h2>
    
    <p>Since I paid for this bike so much I was really careful with handling it.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>I took it to the official service for maintenance.</li>
      <li>I also biked it carefully only on city roads and stored it inside my apartment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Basically I did not do anything that could cause what I will describe next.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Bike Accident</h2>
    
    <p>Unfortunately about half a year ago (summer 2015) I had an accident that ended terrible and could had ended fatally for me.</p>
    
    <p>While waiting on the crossroad for an empty spot to go across the street, I've stepped on my pedal in order to accelerate. After one or two rotations my chain fell off the gears! My feet dropped down on the ground instantly decelerating my body. However, my bike still had an inertia and the front biggest gear hit the back of my right leg's calf.</p>
    
    <p>The force was so strong that the tips of the gear acted as a knife cutting through my skin into my muscle. You can only imagine the pain I was in. My whole leg quickly covered with blood and I was not able to step on that leg at all for the entire next day. It took me at least a week to stabilize the condition.</p>
    
    <p>I was lucky that other cars noticed me and did not run me over!</p>
    
    <h2>The Faulty part - Freehub</h2>
    
    <p>When I disassembled the rear wheel I've found the faulty part - it was freehub made by Shimano.</p>
    
    <figure>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    
    <p>
      Basically the outer part of the freehub that holds rear gears fell apart. It caused the gears to become loose, which caused the chain to fall off.<br>
      It still amazes me how a thick piece of metal could brake like that...
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>The Official Service</h2>
    
    <p>I brought my bicycle the service and the place where I bought my bicycle - the official for Cube in Zagreb/Croatia - <a href="https://keindl-sport.hr/">Keindl Sport</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Since the warranty for parts was only 1 year and at that time my bike was 2 years old, there was no warranty for the freehub and I had to pay over <strong>60€</strong> for the fix.</p>
    
    <p>They told me that this is the second Cube they see with broken freehub and it otherwise never happens that freehub breaks on bikes. They suggested me to write an email so I wrote one to Cube through the contact form on their site.</p>
    
    <h3>Cube Customer Service</h3>
    
    <p>After writing my problem to Cube Customer Service I instantly got their automatic reply.</p>

    <p>After some time I tried to contact them again but with no success - again I got the same automatic reply.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately I did not store what I wrote then but I basically wrote what I've written here. I was expecting to get some kind of reply - I really had a high opinion about Cube.</p>
    
    <h2>Why am I mad?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        First of all, I am mad because I chose, bought and spent enormous amount of money on a product that I was expecting to at least have hight quality crucial parts like freehub.<br>
        In my life I had various kinds of bikes. Some of them worth less than the price of fix of freehub! It never happened to me, neither I heard from anybody that freehub broke.<br>
        <strong>For me this is unacceptable that such a known company which promotes itself as a producer of high quality bikes sells bikes with parts that break out of nothing after 2 years of easy bike usage!</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Second of all, I am mad because in the official service I had to pay for freehub almost as much as for a new cheap bicycle that would probably never had a problem with freehub in its lifetime.<br>
        I understand that there was warranty for one year and that this part had 2 years but considering the fact that this part never brakes <strong>I was expecting a bit more from the official service</strong>!
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, I am mad for <strong>Cube not replying to me at all about this</strong>. I do not know how I should interpret this, but this is definitely unacceptable!<br>
        How can they expect me to ever say anything good about Cubes in the future?
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>
     I want to say that I am generally satisfied with the bike, however, this situation has totally taken me out of place.<br>
      I hope that tweeting this article will help with moving things further for me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I also think that Cube should feel (from the ethical point of view) responsible for situations as the one I described and not totally ignore it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Furthermore, I am not sure if I am just a very rare case for which it happened. If yes, I understand that sometimes errors happen during production.<br>
      However, if there were more cases like this, I consider it as a very serious problem for Quality Assurance department of Cube that will most likely affect their future buyers.
